# Sqalert
Air pressure based perimiter protection using MS5611
and Siren detection to integrate with existing alarm

IDEAS TO IMPLEMENT
- Use of MS6611 with sliding mean to detect sudden changes in pressure
- MQTT client. Check Python course project.

INSIGHTS
- Noise is additive. Might be useless to utilise more than one sensor.

MORE RESEARCH NEEDED
- Suitable board. Raspberry? Arduino? ESP8266?
- Change language to Lua?
